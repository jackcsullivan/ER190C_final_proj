    "## Basic Project Requirements (delete this markdown cell in your final submission)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use this notebook**:  This notebook is the template for your semester project.  Each markdown cell provides instructions on what to do in order to do a successful project.  The cell you're reading right now is the only one you can delete from what you eventually hand in.  For the other cells:\n",
    "1. You may replace the instructions in each cell with your own work but do not edit the cell titles (with the exception of the project title, above).  \n",
    "2. Follow the instructions in each section carefully.  For some sections you will enter only markdown text in the existing cells. For other sections, you'll accompany the markdown cells with additional code cells, and perhaps more markdown, before moving on to the next section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**.  You'll see point allocations listed in each of the section titles below.  In addition, there are other categories for points: \n",
    "1. Visualization (10 points).  Well organized plots and legible plots get high points, as do beautiful and innovative plots.  \n",
    "2. Clarity (5 points). Note that clarity also supports points elsewhere, because if we can't understand what you're explaining, we'll assume you didn't understand what you were doing and give points accordingly!  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each Section or Category, we will give points according to the following percentage scale:\n",
    "1. More than 90%:  work that is free of anything but superficial mistakes, and demonstrates creativity and / or a very deep understanding of what you are doing.\n",
    "2. 80-90%: work without fundamental errors and demonstrates a basic understanding of what you're doing.\n",
    "3. 60-80%: work with fundamental flaws in the analysis and / or conveys that you do not understand the basics of the work you are trying to do.\n",
    "4. Below 60%: Work that is severely lacking or incomplete.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we distinguish *mistakes* from *\"my idea didn't work\"*.  Sometimes you don't know if you can actually do the thing you're trying to do and as you dig in you find that you can't.  That doesn't necessarily mean you made a mistake; it might just mean you needed more information.  We'll still give  high marks to ambitious projects that \"fail\" at their stated objective, as long as that objective was clear and you understood what you were doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice on working in groups:**  We encourage group work.  However to create a level playing field for groups with varying size, we have the following requirements:\n",
    "1. Projects must have at least one distinct quantitative question per student in the group.  Questions can and should be related, but they need to require distinct work efforts, and the interpretation and analysis should cover each question in detail.  If you have any doubt about whether your questions are distinct, consult with the instructors.\n",
    "2. We use a sliding data requirements scale, see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data requirements**:  Projects must use data from a minimum of $1+N_s$ different sources, where $N_s$ is the number of students in the group.  You should merge at least two data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice on Project Topics**:  We want you to do a project that relates to energy and environment topics.  However this is not a hard requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested data sets**:  These are just some ideas for starting points.  You can definitely bring your own data to the table!\n",

    "1. November 19, in lab.  In this lab you'll be expected to have formed groups (if you wish), identified your data sources, done preliminary exploratory data analysis, and decided on a forecasting question.  The instructors will circulate through the room and discuss your progress on the project.  Your progress will constitute part of your grade for that week's lab. \n",
    "2. Novbember 26, in lab.  In this lab you'll be expected to have done some initial forecasting work: build and fit a model, test its accuracy, plot its performance.\n",
    "3. December 11, 6pm: This is when your final project is due.  You will submit your notebook and data to bCourses or GitHub (to be determined).  \n",

In most cases this will mean that you'll frame the answers to your questions as informing one or more *resource allocation* problems.

Max features we only try sqrt as this avoids overfitting since we are sampling from a subset of features for each decision tree instead of each decision tree using the same features. Max depth is a very crucial hyperparameter to tune as it guages overfitting as each decision tree creates more bias the smaller maxDepth is and more variance the larger maxDepth is. We iterate start searching at depth of 9 since we have so much data that we are not worried about overfitting and we want to ensure that the proper complexity can be represented with each tree. We also include the minimum number of samples required to split a node and looked over a small range as to promote more splits since we have so much data. At the end, print the best parameters.\n",

    "We observe that the ```last_week_median``` feature is the most prominent feature. Our MSE is pretty high because we did not normalize our solar irradiance values or features as mentioned in class and here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8961586/do-i-need-to-normalize-or-scale-data-for-randomforest-r-package. But our R^2 coefficients are pretty good and show that we capture a very high majority of the relationship. I do not think our model was overfitting, but instead had high bias that contributed most to this error. Ways we could have mitigated this further would be to collect even more data."
